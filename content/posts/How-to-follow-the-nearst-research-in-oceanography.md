This is the note of my own experiences.

As summarized in my former blog, the new result always from pre-print website, social media, conference. Here I will summary some source in oceanography, especially ocean color,  and also give some methods for following new articles.

# Social media

Actually it’s hard to follow academic in social media, because there are a lot of redundant information.

## Official account for journal and research institute

This is a good way. A lot of famous journal has official account in social media. They even have local language version account. In this way we can get new big result quickly.  Such kind of big paper is hard for me, but I think it is necessary for me.

Some research institute also has official account such as Plymouth. They will also share research progress in social media

# Preprint

In oceanography or earth science, we have Earth ArXiv(https://eartharxiv.org/discover). But as the quality of paper varies a lot. I do not recommend following progress in this site. Maybe  you can search some keywords monthly or just some time you are free.

# Conference

Here are some conference I think worthy attention. Although we always could not get full content from abstract, we can contact the author for further discussion.

1. AGU, EGU and JpGU annual meeting
2. International Ocean Color Science Meetinghttps://iocs.ioccg.org/
3. IEEE IGARSS 
4. ISPRS
5. Ocean Optics Conference
6. Ocean Science Meeting
7. Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference
8. SPIE, Space, Satellites and Sustainability(http://www.spie.org/ss101call)

You can also follow some in this websitehttps://ioccg.org/resources/workshops-and-conferences/

# Journal Subscription

Search “Journal name+subscribe”, you will find the way to subscribe new articles. If this journal publish new article, they will send a email to alert you.

Hear are the journal I think worthy subscription

- Remote sensing of Environment
- Earth System Science Data
- Limnology and Oceanography
- Journal of Geophysical Research: Ocean
- Geophysical Research Letters
- Nature Climate Change
- Nature Geoscience
- PNAS
- Science Advance
- Plos one
- Optical express
- Applied Optics
- Applied Optics
- Global Change Biology
- Fish and Fisheries
- Fishery Oceanography
- Deep Sea Research
- Frontiers in Marine Science
- Scientific Reports
- Remote Sensing

# Google Scholar and ResearchGate

You can search the scientists who have the similar interest with you in google scholar or ResearchGate, and you will get the alerts for their new articles. 

You can also set key words alerts in google scholar.

This methods always could give you new research earlier compared with subscription.

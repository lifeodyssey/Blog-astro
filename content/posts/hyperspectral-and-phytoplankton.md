This is an Annotated Bibliography for the doctor proposal.

Hyperspectral Remote Sensing of Phytoplankton Species Composition Based on Transfer Learning

Hyperspectral Differentiation of Phytoplankton Taxonomic Groups: A Comparison between Using Remote Sensing Reflectance and Absorption Spectra

Distinguishing cyanobacteria from algae in optically complex inland waters using a hyperspectral radiative transfer inversion algorithm

Hyperspectral optical discrimination of phytoplankton community structure in Funka Bay and its implications for ocean color remote sensing of diatoms

Remote estimation of phytoplankton size fractions using the spectral shape of light absorption

On the discrimination of multiple phytoplankton groups from light absorption spectra of assemblages with mixed taxonomic composition and variable light conditions

Linking phytoplankton absorption to community composition in Chinese marginal seas

Another way is to see the analyze the NPP/PSC

Ultimate goal is to propose a hypothesis-test 的论文，并且跟我现在的修士论文有联系

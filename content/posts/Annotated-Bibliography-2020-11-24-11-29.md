最近没有一点科研的状态

鸽了好多博客没写，文章没看

我好累 我好想放弃

我想 回家 

好像那个被我找到的目标 又走远了

# Phytoplankton fluorescence: theory, current literature and *in situ* measurement

Book 'Real-time Coastal Observing Systems *for* Marine Ecosystem Dynamics *and* Harmful Algal Blooms', Chapter 7, 'Phytoplankton fluorescence: theory, current literature and *in situ* measurement' edited by Marcel Baiin.

# Fluorescence component in the reflectance spectra from coastal waters. Dependence on water composition

1. Based on HYDROLIGHT simulations of more than 2000 reflectance spectra from datasets typical of coastal waters with highly variable optically active constituents as well as on intercomparisons with field measurements, the magnitude of chlorophyll fluorescence was analyzed and parameterized as a function of phytoplankton, CDOM, and suspended inorganic matter concentrations. Using
2. Using the parameterizations developed, we show that variations in the fluorescence component of water leaving radiance in coastal waters are due more to the variability of attenuation in the water than to the variability of the fluorescence quantum yield, which we estimate to be relatively stable at around 1%
3. Finally, the ranges of water conditions where fluorescence plays a significant role in the reflectance NIR peak and where it is effectively undetectable are also determined.

我可真喜欢这篇文章，写得真好，看着就舒服。

But it is still a very informative paper for me. Honestly, I do not know a lot about the fluorescence theories and elastic/inelastic scattering before I read this paper.

This is a analyse of NFLH algorithm.

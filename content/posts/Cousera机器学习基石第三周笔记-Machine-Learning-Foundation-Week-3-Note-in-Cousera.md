**Types of Learning**

<!-- more -->

# Learning with Different Output Space

## Credit Approval Problem Revisited

## More Binary Classification Problems

## Multiclass Classification: Coin Recognition Problem

## Regression: Patient Recovery Prediction Problem

## Structured Learning: Sequence Tagging Problem

# Learning With Different Data Label

## Supervised: Coin Recognition Revisited

##　Unsupervised: Coin Recognition without $y_n$

unsupervised multiclass classification $\Leftrightarrow$‘Clustering’:a challenging but useful problem

## Unsupervised: Learning without $y_n$

- Clustering
- [Density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation)
- Outlier Detection

## Semi-supervised:Coin Recognition with Some $y_n$

avoid expensive labeling

## Reinforcement Learning

# Learning with Different Protocol

## Batch Learning

a very common protocol

## Online: Spam Filter that ‘improves’

## Active Learning: Learning by ‘Asking’

# Learning with Different Input Space

## Concrete Features

human intelligence

## Raw Features

need human or machines to convert to concrete ones(feature engineering)

## Abstract Features

again need feature conversion/extraction/construction

# Summary

- Learning with Different Output Space:classification,regression,structured
- Learning with Different Data Label$y_n$:supervised,un/semi-supervised,reinforecement
- Learning with Different Protocol:batch,online,active
- Learning with Different Input Space:concrete,raw,abstract

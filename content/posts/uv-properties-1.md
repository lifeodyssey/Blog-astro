# Retrieval of phytoplankton and colored detrital matter absorption coefficients with remote sensing reflectance in an ultraviolet band

Briefly, this almost same with QAA

1. our analyses indicate that QAA-UV can improve the retrieval of aph and adg, although the improvement in accuracy is not significant for values at 440 nm. 

2. the separation of adg and aph is highly dependent on the accuracy of the ocean color measurements and the estimated total absorption coefficient.



# Characteristics of water leaving reflectance at ultraviolet wavelengths: radiative transfer simulations

   

1. remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the UV bands decreased rapidly with the increase in chlorophyll concentration (Chl) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM).
2. In clean waters, Rrs in the UV bands was relatively large and sensitive to changes in Chl and CDOM, which could be of benefit for satellite retrieval of water organic matter.
3. In eutrophic water, Rrs in the UV bands was quite low, and thence the UV bands could be used as a reference band for atmospheric correction. Compared
4. Compared to the monotonic decreasing effects of Chl and CDOM, concentration of non-algal particles (NAP) had a complex effect on Rrs in the UV bands, i.e., increase and decrease in Rrs in low-moderately and highly turbid waters, respectively.
5. the traditional model for the relationship between Rrs and inherent optical properties (IOPs) could be applied to the UV bands in clean waters; in highly turbid waters, however, its deviation increases and empirical coefficients in the model should be improved.

I think this three figure is very usefull

This use PCA

Usefull information is this

# Extending satellite ocean color remote sensing to the near-blue ultraviolet bands


This is also another method that could increase the UV wavelengths.

But it do not discuss the UV properties.

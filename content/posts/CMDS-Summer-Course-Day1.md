The OCLI application course hosted by EUMETSAT in June 2021 Day1 notes.

I met Lauren Biermann there who publish the first (?) paper of plastic detection using optical satellite.

This course is quite too looooong.

Maybe I only record some useful things

# SNAP

Data download from https://coda.eumetsat.int/#/home

Unpack the data, then you can use world view to know the location of your data

You can use spectra view to get the spectra of specific area.

And use the flag to show land or cloud.

It is a baby. 

# Python

The jupyter file can be found in [here](https://github.com/doclements).
